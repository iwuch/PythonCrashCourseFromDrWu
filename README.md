# PythonCrashCourseFromDrWu
This repository will contain the source codes involved in my class.

## D1 Kickoff Our Crash Course
### Task1: The Zen of python
In this task, we will talk about the environment building of python development and see through the essential of python programming.
### Task2: Make certificates by python
A certimaker package done by Dr.Wu is pushed up to the pypi server and we weill import it to make certificate in one line by invoking this.

## D2 Fundamental of Programming
### Task3: Build up a guess game
The basic knowledge of programming of any language is nothing but the basic concept and use of variable and flow control, which can be learned by a tiny game.
### Task4: Calculate the damage in MOBA Game
Function will make programming more abstractive and more readable by encapsulating lines of codes into one defined sentence of your own taste, thus making codes more consice.

## D3 Data Structures in Python
### Task5: Genrator of random names
A bunch of data can be stored in certain data structures, such as list, tuple, dictionary and set, which are four basic containers that can deal with the generated random names.
### Task6: Prove the Goldbach conjecture
Using for loop and some of the built-in functions in native python interpreter, the classical conjecture raised by Goldbach can be proven using the coding technique.

## D4 Object Oriented Programming
### Task7: Code the Hero class
Everything in python can be regarded as object, from the view of philosophy. Write your first class for Heros in the game Arena of Valor for the first step to Object Oriented Programming!
### Task8: Solve math problems with python
The headaching math problems you took in the exams can be easily soved by several lines of simple codes, the amazing stuff is done by a powerful package named sympy.

## D5 Text Analysis using Baisc Knowledges
### Task9: Count the words number in a novel
If you wanna use machines to complish the tedious jobs like counting the word number of a novel, python is like a swiss knife for these. It is a integrated application of variable, containers and file operations.
### Task10: Analysis the high frequency words in TOEFL
Reproducity is the most charming feature of programming. Apply the knowledge we have grasped in the basic course crash course of python and enjoy the efficiency of programming.

## D6 Application of SVD using Numpy
### Task11: Recommend System based on Cosine Similarity
Recommend system can accurately guess what the user would like to order according to their history score compared with others. SVD decomposition can be used to speed up when caculating the similarity between differnt dishes.
### Task12: Compress RGB picture using SVD
Something like the Twenty-Eighty Law, the infomation in a picture can be abstracted by the most important components represented by the sigular values of matrix. So we can reduce the space one picture occupies by SVD based compression.

## D7 Analyze Douban Data with Pandas
### Task13:Find out the hottest 50 books
Given databases including books.csv, and to_read csv, we can get the hottest 50 books of DouBan by counting the number of people want to read them and visulize them.
### Task14:Find out the hottest tags of those books
In addition to the data given in Task 13, tags.csv and book_tags.csv are also given so that we can know what are the hottest tags to each book found in the previous task.
